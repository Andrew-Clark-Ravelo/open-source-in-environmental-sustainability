# Funding

- **Adoption of the "open source first" criterion in the provision of funding for sustainable technologies**. Our study has shown that open source can have a significant impact on sustainable choices and technology diffusion. However, when it comes to financing sustainable technology projects, open source is often not a decisive investment criterion. A fundamental rethink must take place here. Openness must be recognised as a key indicator for sustainable development. In particular, the investment of public funds can contribute to a trend reversal and ensure that such investments are also beneficial for the general public in the long term. It must be made easier for public research and development projects to develop and promote open source projects with their own financial resources. This can contribute significantly to ensuring that public funds do not end up as proprietary intellectual property of universities or companies, but that free circulation of these developments is possible. Only through open licensing can it be ensured that sustainable developments are actually applied worldwide. 

- **Development of dedicated funds that provide core and maintenance funding**: Stable and secure funding for core product development is foundational for maintaining quality and ongoing project support. Maintenance funding for OSS for sustainability should be given extra attention. This may include creating funds to: 

  - Develop documentation, code libraries, training, or other resources that make it easier for more people to manage and build on existing technologies. 
  - Develop robust solutions to recurrent short-term problems such as solving legacy problems. 
  - Complete migration from legacy code. 
  - Improve the design and user experience of technology; and 
  - Establish or adopt technical standards. 

**The insights, methods and tools developed in this study can contribute to making such investments transparent and more targeted.**
